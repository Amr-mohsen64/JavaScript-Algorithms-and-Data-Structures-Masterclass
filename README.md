# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of classic algorithms and data structure patterns, organized by topic. It is designed as a learning resource for mastering fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Folder Structure

- **frequency_counter/**  
  Frequency counter pattern problems and solutions, including array and string comparison tasks.

- **multiple_pointers/**  
  Multiple pointers pattern problems, such as finding pairs, counting unique values, and checking subsequences.

- **recursion/**  
  Recursive problem solutions, including helper method recursion, pure recursion, and classic recursive algorithms.

- **searching-algorithms/**  
  Linear search, binary search, and naive string search implementations.

- **sliding_window/**  
  Sliding window pattern problems, such as finding maximum or minimum subarray sums.

- **sorting-algorithms/**  
  Sorting algorithm implementations, such as bubble sort.

- **.vscode/**  
  VS Code workspace settings.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:**
   Open the folder in Visual Studio Code for best experience.

3. **Run Examples:**
   - Open any `index.html` file in a topic folder in your browser to run and test the corresponding JavaScript files.
   - Or, run JavaScript files directly using Node.js:
     ```sh
     node path/to/file.js
     ```

## Topics Covered

- Frequency Counter Pattern
- Multiple Pointers Pattern
- Sliding Window Pattern
